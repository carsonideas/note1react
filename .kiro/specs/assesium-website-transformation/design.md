# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the systematic transformation of the existing Nova Notes website into a comprehensive Assesium-branded platform. The transformation involves content replacement, feature updates, dark mode enhancements, and complete bug resolution across all website components.

## Architecture

### Current Website Structure
- **Framework**: React with Vite build system
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for SPA navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dark mode implementation
- **Components**: Modular component architecture with Header, Footer, and page-specific components
- **Pages**: Home, Features, About, Pricing, Contact, Blog, GetStarted, Login

### Transformation Strategy
The transformation will be executed through systematic content replacement and enhancement across four main areas:
1. **Content Layer**: Text, branding, and feature descriptions
2. **Visual Layer**: Dark mode enhancements and design fixes
3. **Functional Layer**: Bug fixes and alignment corrections
4. **Delivery Layer**: Testing and packaging

## Components and Interfaces

- **Feature Content Updates**: Replace generic note-taking features with Assesium's comprehensive educational platform features
- **Marketing Copy Updates**: Update all promotional text to reflect Assesium's brand identity

### Visual Enhancement Components
- **Dark Mode Enhancements**: 
  - Light blue glass background implementation for login/get-started forms
  - Hero page ring color preservation (white rings in dark mode)
- **Design Fix Components**:
  - Element alignment correction system
  - Button color standardization
  - Layout consistency improvements
